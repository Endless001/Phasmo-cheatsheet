      <h2>About The game</h2>
      <p><center>Phasmophobia is the fear of ghosts or supernatural entities, often associated with intense anxiety or panic when confronted with thoughts or situations
         involving spirits or hauntings. People with phasmophobia may experience symptoms like rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, and shortness of breath when faced with
          anything related to the paranormal, such as visiting supposedly haunted locations or watching ghost-related media. The fear is often linked to cultural beliefs, personal 
          experiences, or a vivid imagination. In some cases, the phobia may stem from childhood trauma or being exposed to frightening ghost stories, movies, or TV shows. Treatment
           options for phasmophobia can include cognitive-behavioral therapy, exposure therapy, and relaxation techniques to help individuals manage and overcome their fear.</center></p>
